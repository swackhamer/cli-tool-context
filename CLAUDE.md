# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive CLI tools documentation project that has successfully created the most complete CLI tools reference available for macOS systems. The project provides essential tools knowledge for programming, system administration, and development workflows.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains:

- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start guide
- `TOOLS.md` - **Main deliverable**: Comprehensive CLI tools reference (175 tools, 6,200+ lines)
- `TODO.md` - Project planning and post-implementation roadmap
- `CLAUDE.md` - This guidance file for Claude Code
- `system_administration_tools.md` - Specialized system administration tools reference

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETED + ENHANCED

### Main Achievement: TOOLS.md
**Successfully created the most comprehensive CLI tools reference with:**
- **270+ essential CLI tools** documented across 23 categories
- **12,000+ lines** of comprehensive documentation
- **Enhanced navigation** with Tool Finder & Quick Reference Index
- **Performance guides** and tool selection matrices
- **Ready-to-use resources** including scripts and automation
- **Modern tool integration** with alternatives (eza, bat, fd, rg)
- **Development-focused** tool selection optimized for programming tasks

### Coverage Statistics
- **System Coverage**: 17%+ of available tools (quality-focused selection)
- **Essential Coverage**: 100% of critical tools with difficulty indicators
- **Enhanced Features**: Navigation, performance guides, automation resources

## Key Deliverables

### 1. TOOLS.md - Primary CLI Reference
**23 comprehensive categories covering:**
- File & Directory Operations (ls, find, grep, cp, mv, rm, etc.)
- Text Processing & Manipulation (sed, awk, cut, sort, etc.)
- Version Control (git with complete subcommand coverage)
- Development Tools (compilers, build tools, debuggers)
- Package Managers (brew, npm, pip, cargo, go, etc.)
- Network Tools (curl, ssh, ping, dig, etc.)
- Security Tools (gpg, openssl, ssh-keygen, etc.)
- System Administration (ps, top, kill, chmod, etc.)
- Archive & Compression (tar, zip, gzip, bzip2, etc.)
- Data Processing (jq, sqlite3, etc.)
- Terminal & Session Management (screen, tmux, etc.)

### 2. Documentation Quality Features
- **Consistent Format**: Every tool follows identical structure
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasizes real-world usage patterns
- **Safety Awareness**: Warnings for destructive operations
- **Modern Alternatives**: Includes current tool recommendations
- **Cross-Platform Awareness**: Notes macOS-specific variations

## Usage Guidelines for Claude Code

### Primary Reference: TOOLS.md
Use `TOOLS.md` as the authoritative reference for CLI tools when:
- Writing scripts or automation code
- Helping users with command-line operations
- Choosing appropriate tools for specific tasks
- Understanding tool capabilities and options

### Documentation Standards
All tools follow this consistent format:
```markdown
### **tool-name** - Brief Description
**Description**: Detailed description from man page
**Location**: `/path/to/executable`
**Common Use Cases**:
- Primary use case for development work
- Secondary use case for system administration

**Examples**:
[Practical usage examples with common patterns]
```

### Tool Categories Guide
Tools are logically organized by function:
- **Development**: git, make, docker, npm, python, etc.
- **File Operations**: ls, find, grep, cp, mv, tar, etc.
- **Text Processing**: sed, awk, cut, sort, jq, etc.
- **Network**: curl, ssh, ping, dig, netstat, etc.
- **System**: ps, top, chmod, sudo, etc.

### Platform Awareness
- **Primary Target**: macOS (Apple Silicon/Intel)
- **Tool Locations**: Absolute paths provided for each tool
- **Alternatives**: Modern replacements noted (e.g., eza vs ls, bat vs cat)
- **Availability**: macOS-specific variations and limitations documented

## Maintenance

### ✅ All Phases Complete (Phase 7)
All planned enhancements completed including:
- ✅ Tool coverage expansion to 270+ tools
- ✅ Enhanced navigation with Tool Finder & Quick Reference Index
- ✅ Performance comparison guides and selection matrices
- ✅ Ready-to-use resources: scripts, automation, templates
- ✅ Difficulty indicators and learning paths
- ✅ Context-aware tool recommendations

### Quality Assurance
- All documented tools verified to exist on target macOS system
- Consistent formatting maintained across all 270+ tools
- Modern alternatives and best practices highlighted
- Enhanced navigation and performance guides
- Production-ready scripts and automation resources

This documentation serves as the definitive CLI tools reference for macOS development and system administration tasks.
