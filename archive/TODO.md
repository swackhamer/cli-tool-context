2. Test examples from high-usage tools first
3. Update version-specific information
4. Check for new tool releases and major changes
5. Validate cross-references and internal links

### **Update Procedures**
1. Use `./scripts/update_stats.sh` for metadata consistency
2. Regenerate tool index with current information
3. Update README.md statistics
4. Run full validation suite before committing
5. Document changes in commit messages

## Community Contribution Guidelines

### **Adding New Tools** 
1. Verify tool not already documented in TOOLS.md
