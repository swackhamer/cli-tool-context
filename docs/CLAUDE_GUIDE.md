## Using TOOLS.md Effectively

### Primary Reference Authority
Use `TOOLS.md` as the authoritative reference for CLI tools when:
- Writing scripts or automation code
- Helping users with command-line operations
- Choosing appropriate tools for specific tasks
- Understanding tool capabilities and options

### Quick Tool Lookup Patterns

When users ask about CLI operations:

1. **Search by Task** - Find tools by what they accomplish:
   ```bash
   # User asks: "How do I find large files?"
   # Search for: disk usage, file size, ncdu, dust, du
   ```

2. **Consider Modern Alternatives** - Always present both traditional and modern options:
   ```bash
   # Traditional: grep pattern file.txt
   # Modern: rg pattern file.txt  # Faster, respects .gitignore
   ```

3. **Match Difficulty to User Expertise**:
   - ⭐⭐ Beginner → Simple, safe commands
   - ⭐⭐⭐ Intermediate → More options, some risk
   - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Advanced → Complex operations
   - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert → Requires deep knowledge

### Documentation Standards

All tools follow this consistent format:
```markdown
### **tool-name** - Brief Description
**Description**: Detailed description from man page
**Location**: `/path/to/executable`
**Common Use Cases**:
- Primary use case for development work
- Secondary use case for system administration

**Examples**:
[Practical usage examples with common patterns]
```

### Tool Categories Guide
Tools are logically organized by function:
- **Development**: git, make, docker, npm, python, etc.
- **File Operations**: ls, find, grep, cp, mv, tar, etc.
- **Text Processing**: sed, awk, cut, sort, jq, etc.
- **Network**: curl, ssh, ping, dig, netstat, etc.
- **System**: ps, top, chmod, sudo, etc.

### Key Deliverable Categories

**37 comprehensive categories covering:**
- File & Directory Operations (ls, find, grep, cp, mv, rm, etc.)
- Text Processing & Manipulation (sed, awk, cut, sort, etc.)
- Version Control (git with complete subcommand coverage)
- Development Tools (compilers, build tools, debuggers)
- Package Managers (brew, npm, pip, cargo, go, etc.)
- Network Tools (curl, ssh, ping, dig, etc.)
- Security Tools (gpg, openssl, ssh-keygen, etc.)
- System Administration (ps, top, kill, chmod, etc.)
- Archive & Compression (tar, zip, gzip, bzip2, etc.)
- Data Processing (jq, sqlite3, etc.)
- Terminal & Session Management (screen, tmux, etc.)

### Documentation Quality Features
- **Consistent Format**: Every tool follows identical structure
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasizes real-world usage patterns
- **Safety Awareness**: Warnings for destructive operations
- **Modern Alternatives**: Includes current tool recommendations
- **Cross-Platform Awareness**: Notes macOS-specific variations

## Tool Selection Guidelines

### Context-Based Recommendations

| Task | Small Scale | Medium Scale | Large Scale |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Search Text** | `grep` | `rg` (ripgrep) | `rg --threads` |
| **Find Files** | `find` | `fd` | `fd` with parallel |
| **Process Monitor** | `ps` | `htop` | `btop` |
| **Disk Usage** | `du` | `ncdu` | `dust` |
| **Build System** | `make` | `cmake`/`ninja` | `bazel` |
| **Text Replace** | `sed` | `sd` | `sd -i` |

### Performance Optimization

Suggest faster alternatives when users are:
- Searching large codebases → Use `rg` not `grep`
- Checking disk usage → Use `dust` not `du -h`
- Finding files → Use `fd` not `find`
- Viewing files frequently → Use `bat` not `cat`
- Monitoring processes → Use `procs` not `ps aux`

### Parallel Processing Opportunities

```bash
# Instead of sequential:
for file in *.txt; do process "$file"; done

# Suggest parallel:
fd .txt | xargs -P 8 process
# or
find . -name "*.txt" | parallel process {}
```

## Recommended Tool Combinations

### File Operations Pipeline
```bash
# Finding and processing files - combine these tools:
fd .txt | xargs rg "pattern"           # Modern approach
find . -name "*.txt" | xargs grep "pattern"  # Traditional approach

# Disk usage analysis pipeline:
dust -d 3 | head -20                   # Quick visual overview
ncdu /path/to/analyze                  # Interactive exploration
```

### Text Processing Pipeline
```bash
# Modern text pipeline:
cat file.txt | sd "old" "new" | bat    # Simple replacement with preview

# Data analysis pipeline:
csvcut -c 1,3,5 data.csv | csvstat     # Select columns and analyze
miller --csv stats1 -a mean,sum -f value data.csv  # Statistical operations
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Git enhancement stack:
lazygit                                 # Interactive Git UI
git diff | delta                        # Enhanced diff viewing
git log --oneline | head -10           # Quick history check

# Build system selection:
# Small project → make
# Medium project → cmake + ninja
# Large project → bazel or meson
```

## Best Practices for Claude Code

### Safety Considerations

Always include warnings for:

1. **Destructive Operations**
   - `rm -rf` → Suggest `trash` or `rm -i` first
   - `mv` → Warn about overwriting
   - `chmod 777` → Explain security risks

2. **System-Wide Changes**
   - `sudo` commands → Explain what they modify
   - Network scanners → Only on owned networks
   - System configuration → Suggest backups first

3. **Performance Impact**
   - `find /` → May take very long
   - `grep -r` on large directories → Suggest `rg` instead
   - `masscan` → Can overwhelm networks

### Response Templates

#### For Simple Questions:
```
The tool you need is `toolname` (location: /path/to/tool)
Basic usage: `toolname [options] file`
Example: `toolname -flag input.txt`
Modern alternative: `modern_tool` (faster, better UX)
```

#### For Complex Tasks:
```
This requires multiple tools:
1. First, use `tool1` to prepare data
2. Then pipe to `tool2` for processing  
3. Finally, use `tool3` for output

Complete pipeline:
`tool1 input | tool2 --option | tool3 > output`

Safety note: [any warnings]
Performance tip: [optimization if applicable]
```

### Excellence Standards

Every tool suggestion should include:
- ✅ What it does (brief description)
- ✅ How to use it (basic syntax)
- ✅ Real example (working command)
- ✅ Why use it (benefit over alternatives)
- ✅ Any warnings (safety/performance)
- ✅ Modern alternative (if applicable)

### Pro Tips for Claude Code

1. **Always verify tool availability** before suggesting complex pipelines
2. **Prefer installed tools** over ones requiring installation
3. **Start simple** - basic solution first, then optimize
4. **Include examples** - concrete commands are clearer than descriptions
5. **Cross-reference** - mention related tools for complete solutions
6. **Test commands** - ensure syntax is correct for macOS
7. **Version awareness** - some tools have different options on macOS

## Debugging Assistance

When users encounter issues, check:

1. **Tool Installation**
   ```bash
   which tool_name                      # Is it installed?
   brew list | grep tool_name           # Installed via Homebrew?
   tool_name --version                  # Version check
   ```

2. **Permission Issues**
   ```bash
   ls -la file                          # Check permissions
   whoami                               # Current user
   sudo -l                              # What can user sudo?
   ```

3. **Path Problems**
   ```bash
   echo $PATH                           # Check PATH
   which -a tool_name                   # All locations
   /full/path/to/tool                  # Use absolute path
   ```
