# User notes

## Rustification
= List tools that are popular and have a project that has converted them to rust that is nowt the widely accepted better option
= Put these tools in TOOOLS_TODO.md under its own section

## CLAUDE.md
- Move @docs/CLAUDE_GUIDE.md to project root CLAUDE.md and update to be a good claude.md file
- Merge the rest of the docs into less files and remove duplicate content in those files
- Update the linnks in README.md in the project root pointing to the new right file

## More tools to do
- Find more tools to document for Mac OS X and Linux, Windows is less of a concern.
- Search through homebrew most downloaded monthly to find potential tools to document

## Review tools.md
- Make sure the format is consistent
- Ensure all tools have all attributes that can be filled in for an application such as `platform` are present and formatted correctly
