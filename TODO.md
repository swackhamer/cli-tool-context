# CLI Tools Inventory Project

## Objective
Create a comprehensive TOOLS.md that inventories all CLI application man pages and includes tldr examples for practical usage guidance for Claude.

## Data Sources Identified
- **1,956 man pages** found in system directories (`/usr/share/man`, `/usr/local/share/man`, `/opt/homebrew/share/man`)
- **4,162 tldr pages** available through the installed tldr client
- System binaries in `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Data Collection
- [x] Extract all executable commands from system PATH
- [x] Gather man page descriptions using `whatis` command
- [x] Parse man pages for detailed functionality descriptions
- [x] Collect tldr examples for tools that have them
- [x] Identify tools available on the system vs. tldr-only entries

### Phase 2: Organization & Categorization
- [x] **File & Directory Operations**: ls, find, grep, fd, eza, tree, du, df
- [x] **Text Processing**: sed, awk, cut, sort, uniq, tr, head, tail, cat, less, more
- [x] **Version Control**: git (with subcommands), svn, hg, bzr
- [x] **Network Tools**: curl, wget, ssh, scp, rsync, netstat, ping, traceroute
- [x] **Development Tools**: gcc, clang, make, cmake, python, node, npm, cargo, rustc
- [x] **System Administration**: ps, top, htop, kill, killall, jobs, bg, fg
- [x] **Archive & Compression**: tar, zip, unzip, gzip, gunzip, bzip2, 7z
- [x] **Package Management**: brew, npm, pip, cargo, gem, apt, yum
- [x] **Container Tools**: docker, podman, kubectl, helm
- [x] **Text Editors**: vim, nano, emacs, vi, code
- [x] **Shell Utilities**: bash, zsh, fish, tmux, screen, history

- [x] **Monitoring Tools**: iostat, vmstat, netstat, lsof
- [x] **Process Management**: nohup, disown, timeout, watch

### Phase 3: Documentation Format
Each tool entry should include:
```markdown
### tool-name
**Description**: Brief description from man page
**Purpose**: What Claude would use this for
**Common Use Cases**: 
- Primary use case
- Secondary use case

**Examples** (from tldr when available):
```bash
# Basic usage
command basic_args

# Advanced usage
command --advanced-flag input_file
```
```

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
- [x] Verify all system-available tools are included
- [x] Cross-reference with tldr availability
- [x] Ensure descriptions are accurate and useful for Claude
- [x] Test example commands for correctness
- [x] Organize alphabetically within categories

### Phase 5: Implementation Strategy
1. **Bulk Collection**: Use scripts to gather all tool names and descriptions
2. **Prioritization**: Focus on tools most relevant to programming/development tasks
3. **Integration**: Merge man page descriptions with tldr examples
4. **Validation**: Spot-check entries for accuracy and completeness

## Expected Output Structure

```markdown
