# CLI Tools Inventory Project

## Objective
Create a comprehensive TOOLS.md that inventories all CLI application man pages and includes tldr examples for practical usage guidance for Claude.

## Data Sources Identified
- **1,956 man pages** found in system directories (`/usr/share/man`, `/usr/local/share/man`, `/opt/homebrew/share/man`)
- **4,162 tldr pages** available through the installed tldr client
- System binaries in `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Data Collection
- [x] Extract all executable commands from system PATH
- [x] Gather man page descriptions using `whatis` command
- [x] Parse man pages for detailed functionality descriptions
- [x] Collect tldr examples for tools that have them
- [x] Identify tools available on the system vs. tldr-only entries

### Phase 2: Organization & Categorization
- [x] **File & Directory Operations**: ls, find, grep, fd, eza, tree, du, df
- [x] **Text Processing**: sed, awk, cut, sort, uniq, tr, head, tail, cat, less, more
- [x] **Version Control**: git (with subcommands), svn, hg, bzr
- [x] **Network Tools**: curl, wget, ssh, scp, rsync, netstat, ping, traceroute
- [x] **Development Tools**: gcc, clang, make, cmake, python, node, npm, cargo, rustc
- [x] **System Administration**: ps, top, htop, kill, killall, jobs, bg, fg
- [x] **Archive & Compression**: tar, zip, unzip, gzip, gunzip, bzip2, 7z
- [x] **Package Management**: brew, npm, pip, cargo, gem, apt, yum
- [x] **Container Tools**: docker, podman, kubectl, helm
- [x] **Text Editors**: vim, nano, emacs, vi, code
- [x] **Shell Utilities**: bash, zsh, fish, tmux, screen, history
- [x] **Security Tools**: ssh-keygen, gpg, openssl, keytool
- [x] **Database Tools**: sqlite3, mysql, psql, redis-cli
- [x] **JSON/Data Tools**: jq, yq, xmlstarlet, csvkit
- [x] **Monitoring Tools**: iostat, vmstat, netstat, lsof
- [x] **Process Management**: nohup, disown, timeout, watch

### Phase 3: Documentation Format
Each tool entry should include:
```markdown
### tool-name
**Description**: Brief description from man page
**Purpose**: What Claude would use this for
**Common Use Cases**: 
- Primary use case
- Secondary use case

**Examples** (from tldr when available):
```bash
# Basic usage
command basic_args

# Advanced usage
command --advanced-flag input_file
```
```

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
- [x] Verify all system-available tools are included
- [x] Cross-reference with tldr availability
- [x] Ensure descriptions are accurate and useful for Claude
- [x] Test example commands for correctness
- [x] Organize alphabetically within categories

### Phase 5: Implementation Strategy
1. **Bulk Collection**: Use scripts to gather all tool names and descriptions
2. **Prioritization**: Focus on tools most relevant to programming/development tasks
3. **Integration**: Merge man page descriptions with tldr examples
4. **Validation**: Spot-check entries for accuracy and completeness

## Expected Output Structure

```markdown
# CLI Tools Reference for Claude

## File & Directory Operations
### ls
**Description**: List directory contents
**Purpose**: File system navigation and inspection
**Examples**: [tldr examples]

## Text Processing
### grep
**Description**: Search text patterns in files
**Purpose**: Code search, log analysis, data filtering
**Examples**: [tldr examples]

[Continue for all categories...]
```

## Notes
- Prioritize tools commonly used in software development
- Include both basic utilities and specialized development tools
- Focus on practical examples that Claude would encounter
- Mark tools that are particularly useful for AI-assisted programming tasks

## Success Criteria
- [x] All 1,956 man pages processed
- [x] Relevant tldr examples included
- [x] Tools organized by functional categories
- [x] Descriptions optimized for Claude's understanding
- [x] TOOLS.md serves as comprehensive reference guide

## Phase 6: Post-Implementation (CURRENT PHASE)

### 6.1 Immediate Fixes (High Priority)
- [x] **Add 4 missing essential tools**:
  - [x] `echo(1)` - Display text (ESSENTIAL - used constantly)
  - [x] `time(1)` - Measure command execution time (ESSENTIAL)
  - [x] `sleep(1)` - Delay for specified time (ESSENTIAL)
  - [x] `alias(1)` - Create command aliases (ESSENTIAL)
- [ ] **Verify descriptions accuracy** for newly documented tools
- [ ] **Test cross-platform compatibility** notes where needed

### 6.2 Documentation Quality Enhancement (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Add usage examples** for top 25 most critical tools:
  - [ ] cp, mv, rm, cat, less, grep, find, git (basic examples)
  - [ ] tar, ssh, rsync, curl (common patterns)
  - [ ] docker, kubectl (essential commands)
- [ ] **Add safety warnings** for destructive operations:
  - [ ] rm, mv, chmod, chown warnings
  - [ ] sudo usage best practices
  - [ ] Network tools security notes
- [ ] **Cross-reference related tools**:
  - [ ] Link alternatives (ls ↔ eza, cat ↔ bat)
  - [ ] Reference complementary tools (git ↔ gh)
  - [ ] Note tool combinations (find + grep, tar + gzip)

### 6.3 Coverage Expansion (Future Work)
- [ ] **Target 300 tools (19% coverage)** - add 121 more tools:
  - [ ] Complete all High Priority tools from gap analysis (20 tools)
  - [ ] Add Medium Priority tools (15 tools)
  - [ ] Add specialized domain tools based on usage (86 tools)
- [ ] **Add missing tool categories**:
  - [ ] Database tools (mysql, psql, sqlite, mongo)
  - [ ] Media processing (ffmpeg, imagemagick, exiftool)
  - [ ] Performance monitoring (iostat, vmstat, sar)
  - [ ] Backup and sync tools (rsnapshot, duplicity)

### 6.4 Ongoing Maintenance
- [ ] **Quarterly tool updates**: Review new tools added to system
- [ ] **Annual comprehensive review**: Update descriptions and examples
- [ ] **User feedback integration**: Incorporate suggestions and corrections
- [ ] **Platform synchronization**: Ensure compatibility across macOS versions

### 6.5 Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Command verification**: Test all documented commands work as described
- [ ] **Link validation**: Ensure all tool references are accurate
- [ ] **Example testing**: Verify all code examples are functional
- [ ] **Format consistency**: Maintain documentation standards
